observable

some servvices take long time to execute
if we call it synchronosly
then we call service and wait for response 
so the entire browser will hang
so we call all http services asynchronously

it is one of best approach to implement to asynchronous op
if we want ajax req using http module, so angular in turn makes use of this observable
over here we know what url to call
what should happen we get an response back
what should happen when we get an error back
we can define all that as part of an observable

observable is not really executed 
until we do a subscribe

big adv 
just declare what needs to be done
then continue execute rest of the code	
when response comes it will be appropiately handled
